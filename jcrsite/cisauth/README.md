# CIS Auth

This simply authenticates to the university servers. We don't want to store passwords locally as we'll be breaching the university regulations.

We first check the credentials are good, and then if they are, we check they are a student at Aidan's. We also deal with getting their name and basic details needed for the system to work correctly.
