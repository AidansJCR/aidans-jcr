# Aidan's JCR Website
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AidansJCR/aidans-jcr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AidansJCR/aidans-jcr)
## Introduction
This is the start of something new... the creation of a website designed BY students, FOR students. Rather than being a site dedicated entirely to selling the college to external students, it should provide a balance between selling the college and helping the college members settle in, making their lives that little bit easier.

That's the mentaility I have when creating this site.

## Want to help with development?
We encourage people to get involved with this project! Whether you are a hardcore Django/Python developer, or want to learn programming, get in contact! If you are somewhat knowledgeable about programming, simply send a pull request to help fix any issues you've encountered. For those who want to learn more, email the IT Officer at `it@st-aidans.com`. 

For those non-techy characters amongst you, do not fear! If you have any interest in design/art, we welcome people to help contribute to the style of the site, creating icons/artwork to make the website that little bit nicer to visit.

## Requirements:
+ Python3
+ Django
+ Wagtail CMS

## Getting Started
If you want to download a local copy of the website, simply clone the repository.

You might also need to install certain libraries for Linux, as found on the Getting Started with Wagtail page.

## Current Projects
We are trying to replace the current site with this new one before the term is out. Therefore, we have a number of tasks we
need to do:

- Host images on AWS S3
- Improve front page UI with new images from Summer events
- Basic college info and photos (ready for freshers)

We are also eventually going to work out a more permanent hosting situation, be that S3 and Heroku or a custom Docker image.

This also needs to be the centre point for various other college features. We still need to build the Aidan's Dashboard,
Shop ordering system (to replace the old one), Sports and Societies web area, and make the site itself actually nice for 
potential new Technology Committee members next year.

Oh, and if all else fails: fix JavaScript errors!
