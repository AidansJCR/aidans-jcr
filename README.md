# Aidan's JCR Website
## Introduction
This is the start of something new... the creation of a website designed BY students, FOR students. Rather than being a site dedicated entirely to selling the college to external students, it should provide a balance between selling the college and helping the college members settle in, making their lives that little bit easier.

That's the mentaility I have when creating this site.

## Want to help with development?
We encourage people to get involved with this project! Whether you are a hardcore Django/Python developer, or want to learn programming, get in contact! If you are somewhat knowledgeable about programming, simply send a pull request to help fix any issues you've encountered. For those who want to learn more, email the IT Officer at `it@st-aidans.com`. 

For those non-techy characters amongst you, do not fear! If you have any interest in design/art, we welcome people to help contribute to the style of the site, creating icons/artwork to make the website that little bit nicer to visit.
